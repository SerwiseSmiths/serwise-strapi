```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Access the admin panel at:
```

### Seeding Data

To populate the database with initial data:

```bash
# Seed device types, services, and subscriptions
npm run seed

# Seed parts and repairs inventory
npm run seed:parts
```

## 📦 Collection: Parts

The Parts collection manages all replacement parts, repairs, and services. It's organized by:

**Types:**

### Quick Example

Access parts through the API:

```bash
# Get all active parts
curl http://localhost:1337/api/parts?filters[status][$eq]=ACTIVE

# Get all electrical components
curl http://localhost:1337/api/parts?filters[category][$eq]="Electrical Components"

# Get all repair services
curl http://localhost:1337/api/parts?filters[type][$eq]=Repair
```
